Questions:

    Which command did you like the most? 
    Merge. Becouse its nondestructive.
    In which cases it is better to use git merge and when git rebase?
    Merge we use when we don't have new commits on master branch and its undestructive, 
    but it will make rubbish in commits hictory. 
    rebase we use when we have new commits on master branch 
    and we want to put commits from our side-branch AFTER masterbranch commits.
