    Used public repo in github. https://github.com/valhalla1193/GitHomeworkByKirillPyshnenko
    created file list.txt with names.
    Then pulled to local repo.
    Then changed list.txt in GitHub (public) repo.
    Created new local branch and localy changed list.txt.
    Switch to main(master) branch and pulled changes from public.
    then merge new local branch to main.
    Resolve conflicts:
    First time – accept local changes instead of remote.
    Second time – accept remote changes instead of local.
    Third time – accept both.
